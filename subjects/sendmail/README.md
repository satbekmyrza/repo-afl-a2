# Setup

This repository contains self-contained part of Sendmail with CVE-1999-0206.  

# Building the harness

This subject comes with a ready harness `main.c`.

Building the harness and Sendmail: 

```bash
afl-clang-fast -g -o m1-bad mime1-bad.c main.c -I .
```

# Running AFL

Let's create an input seed:
```bash
mkdir input
echo hi > input/1
```

```bash
afl-fuzz -i input/ -o out/ ./m1-bad @@
```

`@@` at the end is used to tell AFL how to pass a filename to the target program. 

# Seeds

Choosing good seeds speeds up AFL's bug finding capabilities. Run AFL with a different input as follows:

```bash
echo -e "a=\nb=" > input/1
afl-fuzz -i input/ -o out/ ./m1-bad @@
```

Depending on your seed input, you may observe crash at different time points.

# Deliverables

1. A table: You should create a table that compares the time when the first crash occurs depending on which of the two inputs is used in fuzzing. You can get this information from the name of the file that is generated by AFL. For example, `ls out/default/crashes/` will show something similar to the following:

```bash
README.txt
id:000000,sig:06,src:000000,time:99,op:havoc,rep:16
id:000001,sig:06,src:000000,time:307,op:havoc,rep:16
```

In the above case, the first crash occurs at time 99. 

2. The content of the file that causes the first crash. Compare this content with the two different seeds used for fuzzing. Explain why crash occurs faster with one input than with anohter input.
